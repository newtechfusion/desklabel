          <p>A healthy lifestyle starts at home.&nbsp; If we begin teaching children early how to  make healthy decisions at home they're much more likely to carry that kind of  thinking with them wherever they go.&nbsp; Healthy  living at home is crucial because that is where your child will be spending  most of their time and because that is where they pick up most of their habits,  both good and bad.&nbsp; <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating  a healthy environment in your home that promotes physical activity, learning  and a nutritional diet will benefit every member of your household.&nbsp; It's about increasing the quality of your  life and that of your children.&nbsp; You have  to set the right example for your children by making the healthier choices even  when they aren't the easiest.&nbsp; The good  news is, often they are the easier choice and will definitely make you life  more rewarding in the future.<br>

              <li>Have meals at the table together rather than  dispersed and distracted</li>

              <li>Eat lean meats rather than non-lean meats</li>

              <li>Limit television to 2 hours or less each day for  children over 2 years old with at least 1 hour consisting of educational

              <li>Use vegetable oil instead of solid fats</li>

              <li>Buy "no sugar added" juice</li>
              <li>Use pack lunches instead of buying lunches at  school or pre-made lunches.&nbsp; This way you'll  have control of exactly what                  your child is eating as well as the portions.</li>
              <li>Don't ever be too busy for breakfast</li>

      <p>A birthday is a day to celebrate life.&nbsp; What better way to do that than with a party  that promotes health to help keep those birthdays rolling in.&nbsp; Having a health themed birthday party doesn't  mean you have to sacrifice any of the entertainment or food offerings that can  be found at other parties.&nbsp; It just means  that better, healthier choices have been made right down to the cake.&nbsp; (Yes you can still have birthday cake and eat  it too.)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As in  other situations, it's proven that when kids are given healthy options they are  just fine with them, which means sugary icing and greasy chips aren't a  requirement for pleasing party guests.&nbsp;  Even the setting and activities of the party can be focused on healthy  living.&nbsp; In fact, birthday parties are a  great way to get kids away from the video games and interacting and moving  instead.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luckily  today there's awareness in our country of our overall declining health from  poor diet and exercise.&nbsp; This awareness  has brought healthy eating into the forefront and now there are more places  than ever offering a healthier selection of food.&nbsp; So get creative with some of the suggestions  listed below and have a healthy birthday this year!</p>

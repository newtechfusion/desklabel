    <p>Summer belongs to kids.&nbsp;  It's a time marked by freedom from school studies in exchange for a  little relaxation.&nbsp; Though kids might be  able to relax on their school work, summer isn't the time to relax on healthy  nutrition and physical activity.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>With  more free time on their hands kids have no excuse for skimping on their hour of  needed physical activity each day.&nbsp; It's  also the perfect time to learn more about living healthy without having to  worry about mastering other subjects.<br>
    </p>
    <p>So don't  let the summer go to waste and further add to the health problems of American  youth by sitting in front of a T.V. all day.&nbsp;  Summer is the time to get outside and get kids in action!&nbsp; There's plenty of ways to still enjoy a fun  summer break while also living healthy.</p>
    <p><span class="style3">Sports</span><br>
      Summer  can quickly fall into boredom if kids are disjointed from their friends and not  interacting with their peers.&nbsp; Summer  sports programs are a great way for kids to make new friends, be social and get  exercise all at the same time among many other benefits.&nbsp; Give your kid the choice of what sport they  want to play and in what surroundings.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Kids' sports can be organized by formal leagues, loose pick-up games, scheduled  classes or even neighborhood gatherings.&nbsp;  The most important thing is that the child is comfortable and enjoying  the sport whether it be a martial arts class or a neighborhood game of  dodgeball.<br>
    </p>
    <p>It's extremely important that parents teach kids about  proper technique and safety when playing a sport.&nbsp; Find more info on <a title="" accesskey="2" href="http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=57281/">sports safety</a> here.</p>

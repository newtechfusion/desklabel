        			<p>Obesity in children is an issue that has recently come to  light as health experts begin to gather information on the epidemic.&nbsp; At this time physicians are learning more  about the problem and its causes, however there are some factors that are  already known.&nbsp; These obesity factors  have been found to increase a child's risk of becoming obese.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we  know, obesity in children often leads to obesity in adulthood.&nbsp; That's why it's so important that we tackle to  problem early and obtain as much information as possible.&nbsp; As a teacher it's your job to prepare your  students for the future, to arm them with information to help them make the  most of life.&nbsp; One of life's most  important lessons that you can teach them is the factors of obesity and what  they can do to protect their health from it.</p>
      <p class="style5">Factors that Influence Obesity</p>
      <p><span class="style5">Diet/Nutrition </span><br>
        This is  one of the biggest factors in a child's health and weight.&nbsp; Educating children on the different food  groups, healthy portions and nutritional values like saturated fat and protein  will help them make better diet decisions.<br>
        <span class="style5">Activity Level</span><br>
        <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>One of the changes that  researchers and physicians have noted among children that is leading to the  rise in obesity is their activity level.&nbsp;  Less children are getting the physical activity they need and more  children are spending more time on sedentary activities which aren't physical  and have no health benefits.&nbsp; So teach  your kids about the benefits of physical activity.&nbsp; Make sure to point out physical activity.</p>

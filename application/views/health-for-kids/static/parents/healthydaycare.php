        <p>We can make all the right decisions at home, we can pack our  kids lunches and we can make sure their day is filled with the right  activities. However, when they're not at  home or with you the matter of your child's health is somewhat out of your  control.&nbsp; You aren't there to look over  their shoulder and make sure that they a following the healthy guidelines you've  worked so hard to establish.<br>
          That's  why choosing the right day care is so important.&nbsp; They are an extension of your authority as to  the healthy lifestyle you are implementing with your child.&nbsp; If the day care you choose doesn't understand  the choices you have made for the health of your child or they can't provide an  environment to support those decisions, then all the work you've done can be  derailed.<br>
          So we've  provided you with a checklist for some things to look for to find the healthy  day care that's right for your family.&nbsp;  Depending on your needs you child could be in this environment for a  good part of their week and the day care facilitators will become role models  for your child.&nbsp; Take the time and do  your research before dropping them off to make sure those role models will  support your healthy lifestyle.<br>

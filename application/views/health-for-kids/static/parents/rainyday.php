          <p>In order to live a well-rounded healthy lifestyle physical  activity should be incorporated into your child's daily activities.&nbsp; Exercise helps our bodies to reach peak  performance and is known to reduce health risks like cardiovascular  problems.&nbsp; Exercise also aides in  building overall strength, bone density, healthy joints and muscles all while  helping to maintain a healthy weight.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In  addition exercise has also been shown to help in other ways as well.&nbsp; Children who get the appropriate amount of  daily exercise also enjoy the ability to sleep better as well as reduce stress  levels.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even  given all the health benefits that come with exercise 50% of American adults  still don't get enough exercise.&nbsp; Just  like with our nutrition, the exercise habits we create when we're young are  usually carried over into our adult life. &nbsp;So get your kid moving now to keep them  healthy well into future.<br>
          </p>
          <p><span class="style3">Scary Stats</span><br>
            There are some disturbing trends  that are forming among children and teens as far as the level of physical  activity they're getting.&nbsp; Overall kids  2-19 aren't getting nearly enough exercise to maintain a healthy  lifestyle.&nbsp; Below are some recent statistics  on children and exercise.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>As of 2006 less than one third of 15 years olds got  the minimum amount of required physical activity during the week and on  weekends it dropped to just 17%</li>
            <li>On average kids spend 5 ½ hours a day on media  driven sedentary activities</li>
            <li>3 hours of the 5 ½ is spent watching television</li>
            <li>Teens spend an average of 6 hours a day on media  driven sedentary activities</li>
            <li>1 in 3 children in America are overweight or  obese</li>
            <li>The likelihood of cardiovascular disease, Type  II diabetes, asthma, sleep apnea, and certain types of cancer in children is  increased by obesity</li>
            <li>Only 10% of schools offer daily physical  education classes, and many of those don't meet the time requirements of weekly  exercise</li>
          </ul>
          <p><span class="style3">How much physical  activity does my child need?</span><br>
            Studies by the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS) have revealed that the majority of children should be  getting approximately 60 minutes of physical activity basically every day.&nbsp; The activity itself isn't as important as  making sure it hits on the 3 criteria of healthy exercise: strength, endurance and  flexibility.</p>
          <p>You can use a <a href="http://www.calorieking.com/tools/exercise_calories.php/">calorie calculator</a> to estimate about how many calories each type of physical activity burns.<br>
          </p>
          <p><span class="style3">Exercise for ages 2-3</span><br>
            At this  age toddlers are developing their motor skills, such as running and  throwing.&nbsp; Children at this age have  energy to spare for physical activity, so they can benefit from up to 1 ½ hours  of daily exercise.&nbsp; A good exercise plan  is to allow them 60 minutes of unstructured activity that is something they're  conducting as well as 30 minutes of structured exercise time.<br>
          </p>
          <p>Recommended  exercises for this age group include traditional games like tag and leap frog  as well as activities that include age appropriate toys.&nbsp; Even a trip to the park is an easy way to get  in an hour of exercise with your child.</p>
          <p><span class="style3">Exercise for ages 4-5</span><br>
            By the  time your child is 4-5 years old they have developed their motor skills enough  to control the basics.&nbsp; At this stage  they are working on further improving balance and increasing their physical  skill set.<br>
          </p>
          <p>Though  an hour is the minimum required amount of physical activity in this age group  up to 2 hours of exercise is beneficial.&nbsp;  The exercise should be split between an hour of structured activity that  you plan and an hour of unstructured activity that the child is able to decide  on.<br>
          </p>
          <p>At this  age focus on activities that help them work on their balance and hand-eye  coordination like catch or gymnastics.&nbsp;  Depending on your child's physical abilities and comfort level more  involved exercises like learning to swim or ride a bike is also an option.&nbsp; From 4-5 years old is also when your child  can start participating in smaller scale sports centered activities.&nbsp; However, you should try to limit the number  of people involved and only focus on the basics of the game.<br>
            <br>
            <span class="style3">Exercise for ages  6-12</span><br>
            During  the age from 6-12 it's important to start really laying the groundwork for  healthy exercise habits.&nbsp; This is the  time when kids can really start becoming more involved with the decisions they  make in regards to exercise.&nbsp; This is  also when many children start participating in organized sports teams.<br>
          </p>
          <p>From  6-12 years old 60 minutes of exercise is the required minimum.&nbsp; This is when you can help your child really  develop a fitness routine with team sports that meet a few times a week as well  as activities they can do regularly at home.&nbsp;  There's also the option of enrolling them in activities like a yoga  class, rock climbing or even a kid-friendly gym.<br>
          </p>
          <p><span class="style3">Exercise for ages  13-18</span><br>
            This  could possibly be the most vital time for your child to keep up daily physical  activity.&nbsp; That's because as kids get  older the amount of exercise they get drops, starting at age 13 for girls and  15 for boys.&nbsp; In addition to health  benefits, such as weight management, physical activity can increase self esteem  and a positive self image among this age group which is also very important.<br>
          </p>
          <p>Again  60 minutes of exercise is recommended for kids that are 13-18 years old.&nbsp; In this age group team sports is still a great  option and a natural choice for kids who've been participating in them  already.&nbsp; However, teens tend to drop out  of these sports so your encouragement can be a big help.&nbsp; It's important to let them choose the  activity that they want to do as they are definitely flexing their independent  thought muscles at this age.&nbsp; Another  good idea is to have your child plan group activities with friends.&nbsp; This way they can still get in their social  time, which is part of the reasons exercise drops off in this age group. <br>
            <br>
            <span class="style3">Improve Your Child's  Exercise Habits</span><br>
            <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Ultimately your child's  activity level is up to them.&nbsp; However,  you can encourage them to get enough exercise easily.&nbsp; It just takes making a few changes to see a  real difference.<br>
          </p>
          <p><span class="style4">Your Activity:</span><br>
            Children  are going to be influenced by the adults around them.&nbsp; That's why it's so important that you set a  good example.&nbsp; If you aren't getting  enough exercise it will be hard to explain to a child why they need to keep up  their physical activity.&nbsp; Start making changes  in your own work out regimen and not only will you improve the chances of your  child getting active to stay healthy, but you as well will feel the health  benefits.<br>
          </p>
          <p><span class="style4">Exercise Together:</span><br>
            A  perfect way to implement the prior point is to plan physical activities that  you and your child can do together.&nbsp; Not  only will this give you quality time together but it will give you both a  chance to get your heart pumping.&nbsp; It's  also sometimes easier to stick with it if there's someone else to hold you  accountable and enjoy the activity with.<br>
          </p>
          <p><span class="style4">Kid Friendly Exercise:</span><br>
            Exercise  for kids doesn't have to feel like exercise.&nbsp;  By choosing activities that are fun, getting your kid moving won't be as  much of a struggle and the duration of activity will likely last longer.&nbsp; Also try to incorporate activities that are  new.&nbsp; This will keep your kid mentally  involved as they learn something new and broaden their perspective on what can  considered be exercise.<br>
          </p>
          <p><span class="style4">Reduce Sedentary Activities:</span><br>
            Sedentary  activities are those that require very little exertion and aren't considered  exercise.&nbsp; Things like watching  television and playing video games fall into this category.&nbsp; So to improve your child's chances of getting  the daily physical activity they need you must reduce these activities.&nbsp; The easiest way to do so is to eliminate or  limit the temptation by not having these electronics around or easily accessible.<br>
          </p>
          <p>Definitely  avoid putting a television in your child's room.&nbsp; Also set limits on the amount of time your  child is allowed to take part in these sedentary activities.&nbsp; It might be tough on the child at first but  in the long run they'll be able to cope with a better balance in their  activities. </p>

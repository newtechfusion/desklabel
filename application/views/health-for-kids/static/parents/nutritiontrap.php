        <p>The road to health is often bumpy with lots of fast food  restaurants beckoning you to pull over.&nbsp; But  with your child's health you can't afford to keep falling into the potholes of  poor nutrition.&nbsp; Below is a quick  reference list for nutrition traps to avoid.&nbsp;  Some of them should be rather obvious, however some may surprise you.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="style4">Being  home alone</span> &ndash; When left home alone kids have free range of whatever is in  the kitchen and no one there to approve of what they're eating.</li>
          <li class="style4">School Vending  Machines </li>
          <li><span class="style4">Food  portions that are too big</span> &ndash; pay attention to how much your child is  actually consuming and the portion sizes that are given on food packing.</li>
          <li class="style4">TV in the  bedroom</li>
          <li class="style4">Rewarding  them with treats</li>
          <li><strong><span class="style5">Overly  strict diets: both clean your plate and limit what you eat methods</span> &ndash; </strong>You should  never go to the extremes with your child's diet.&nbsp; This isn't teaching them healthy habits, in  fact it's negatively affecting their mental connection with food.&nbsp; To curb this problem you shouldn't prohibit  all sweets or likewise require a child to eat everything on their plate if they're  full.</li>
          <li><strong><span class="style5">Unhealthy  habits of parents</span> &ndash; </strong>You're the one setting an example so it should be a  good one</li>
          <li><strong><span class="style5">Not involving  kids in the food buying and preparing processes</span> &ndash;</strong> Getting kids involved  with buying groceries and making meals will expose them to the choices they  will have to make when they are adults and also serve as hands on learning to  make healthy nutrition not only make more sense but be more enjoyable.</li>
        </ul>
